# aicoding: Vibe Coding Playground

Welcome to `aicoding`, an experimental project dedicated to exploring and mastering **Vibe Coding** techniques using advanced AI Agent collaboration.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding is a philosophy where developers collaborate with autonomous AI agents to build software at the speed of thought. It emphasizes:
- **Interface-First Design**: Define contracts, let AI handle implementation.
- **Agentic Workflows**: Use structured loops (like Ralph Loop) for complex tasks.
- **Verification**: Trust but verify through rigorous testing artifacts.

## Architecture: The Ralph Loop

This project uses the **Ralph Loop** development workflow (Strict Mode):

1.  **Input**: User defines a need.
2.  **Design (PRD)**: AI generates a detailed Product Requirements Document.
3.  **Conversion**: PRD is converted to machine-readable `prd.json`.
4.  **Execution**: Agents execute User Stories one by one, verifying each step.
5.  **Archive & Merge**: Completed tasks are archived and code is merged.

## Key Features

- **Terminal Tool**: A secure, confirm-first terminal execution environment.
- **Agent Core**: TypeScript-based agent logic adhering to ISP (Interface Segregation Principle).
- **Skill System**: Modular skills (PRD, Ralph) to extend agent capabilities.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3.  Start the agent environment: `npm start`.
